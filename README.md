Sarah 'Log Back In' Plugin
==========================

This plugin enables Sarah to log back into your Mac. This is
useful if you put your Mac to sleep at night, and when you start
it again in the morning, and a login prompt appears, you can ask
Sarah to log you back in.

This plugin uses the Java Robot class to enable the magic.

Sarah really can do this. See the short demo at this URL:

Developers
----------

* To create a jar file, see the script in the deploy/ directory.
* You should also be able to create a jar file more easily now
  by running `sbt package`, but i haven't tested that yet.
